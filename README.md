### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer, known for working in fast-paced and startup environments! Most of my work experience is in full-stack engineering, and lately I've been focusing on implementing design patterns into my work, such as Facade, Singleton, and Factory. I believe in continual learning, and have a passion for all things computer related, keeping up with new languages, libraries, frameworks, and all things tech!

I am currently learning:
- Design Patterns
- C# through Unity Game Development
- AWS (Cloud Practitioner Certification)

I have experience in:
- Laravel
- Node/Deno JS Runtimes
- Python scripting
- Go API development
- MySQL database management
- Docker container setup and management

I believe in:
- Constantly learning new things
- Writing clean, elegant and organized code
- Using the right language, library, or framework for the job, not just the one I know
- Following industry standards but not being afraid of thinking outside the box
